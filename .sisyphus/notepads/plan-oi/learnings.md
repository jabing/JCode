- Task: Update jcode-analyst description to concise English and sync across config paths.
- Actions taken:
  - Edited config/agents/jcode-analyst.md to replace multi-line description block with single-line description: "Problem analysis and risk assessment".
  - Updated external agent file at C:\Users\jabin\.config\opencode\agent\jcode-analyst.md to set the same description line.
- Verification notes:
  - If you have a lint/build pipeline for md front matter, it should still parse.
- Outcome:
  - Two files updated to reflect concise English description.
